        <p>
            You must approve the terms of our services and the payments we charge you. <br> <br>
            confidentiality and privacy -<br>
            In order to use our system, you will be asked to enter two email addresses. The first address
            must be legally owned by you! You will be prompted to provide access by username and
            password.<br>
            Once you entered both addresses, and opened read access to your mailbox, you basically
            gave us access to send our feature into your mailbox.<br>
            You undertake here that the main mailbox is your absolute and legal ownership.<br><br>
            Once you have registered to the site, we save your login information in the "logged in" state.
            We do this to make it easier for you in case you want to produce several documents, or simply
            use the site more than once. So we simply save you a new registration process every time.
            You can always choose to disconnect from the site, by clicking the "Exit" button. As long as
            you haven't clicked the logout button, you will be in the online state.
            We save your user information in a cookie, in accordance with the rules of global regulation,
            and according to your consent to the use of cookies.<br> <br>
            From the moment you register on the website, you will be asked by Google or Microsoft to
            confirm granting permissions to our system, log in to your email and read the correspondence.
            Please note, the permission we are asking for is read only. We will never be able to send an
            email on your behalf or do any active action within your email box. We can only read
            correspondence.<br> <br>
            If you do not approve the permission to read, then we will not be able to produce the document
            for you.<br> <br>
            You should know that absolutely, we do not have access to the documents that you produce
            through our website.<br>
            We don't save your documents, we don't read them, we don't send them and we don't use them
            in any way.<br>
            To be honest, the process of creating the document is done on your device, not on our servers.
            So you can rest assured that the privacy of your information is fully preserved. <br><br>
            We do not have human access to the email boxes you have entered. That means no human
            being can read your email correspondence. In order to read the correspondence and compile
            them into a document, we run software that knows how to do this.<br> <br>
            Our software went through a very long and deep process in order to receive security approvals
            from Google and Microsoft. The process that these companies required of us, is actually to
            make sure that we do not have human access to your correspondence, but only software. And
            in any case, the process of producing the aforementioned document is done outside of our
            servers - on your device.<br> <br>
            We read the correspondence according to your search settings, such as: correspondence
            between you and the other address you entered into our system, correspondence between a
            specified date range, correspondence that contains or excludes certain keywords you have
            chosen.<br> <br>
            We do save the addresses that you enter and indicate for which you want to generate a
            document. But we promise you not to use the addresses in any way. We also do not transfer
            the addresses to any third party.<br>
            The documents we generating - <br>
            We generate the documents by code in the PHP language. It is one of the leading
            programming languages in the world. <br>
            The document we produce is a PDF.<br> <br>
            FYI, a PDF document is not editable! Once we have created the document, you will not be
            able to edit it in any way.<br> <br>
            Depending on your settings, we allow you to highlight certain keywords. We do this
            automatically. This means that you may find yellow markings in the document.<br> <br>
            The duration of the production time of the document depends on the amount of
            correspondence that our system found in your mailbox. Naturally, the more correspondences
            there are, the longer the duration will be.<br>
            Please be patient, sometimes it can take long minutes. <br> <br>
            We declare here that we cannot guarantee that our system was able to locate all the
            correspondence you requested. In other words, since our system is technological, the success
            rate depends on several different factors such as the type of your device, the type of your
            browser, the amount of correspondence there is, the quality of your device's connection to the
            Internet, the load on our servers, and more. We hereby declare that sometimes our system may
            not be able to collect 100 percent of all the correspondence you requested. <br>
            If you are sure that there is a real gap between the amount of correspondence we found, and
            the amount of authentic correspondence that exists in your email box - please contact us and
            we will be very happy to try to help find all the correspondence, or alternatively, refund your
            payment. Contact us at the contact details written below.<br> <br>
            As mentioned, the document that we produce for you is a collection of all the correspondence
            between the two addresses that you entered, and according to the settings that you chose. We
            do not do any additional manipulation on the document. The document faithfully and blindly
            reflects all correspondence.<br>
            Payments and costs -<br>
            The price we demand for each document varies from time to time. We do guarantee that the
            price we will show you at the time of payment is the absolute price charged to your credit card. <br><br>
            We declare that we have no access at all to your credit card. In order to clear your credit card,
            and collect payment for our services, we use Stripe, one of the leading clearing companies in
            the world. We send them the cost of the service, and you will be required to fill in the credit
            information.<br>
            You should know, the page for filling out the credit information is not on our website, but on the
            clearing company's website. From here you will know that your credit information is protected in
            the strictest manner under the custody of the clearing company.<br> <br>
            Once our system has generated the requested document for you, you will first be asked to pay
            for it. If you do not agree to pay for the document, then it will be deleted and you will not have
            access to it. In order to download the document you have to pay.<br> <br>
            If you would like an invoice-receipt, you can contact us and we will issue one for you easily and
            happily.<br> <br>
            If the currency that we present on the website does not match the currency in your bank
            account, then the credit company will convert the transaction to the currency that represents
            your bank account. The currency conversion and payment may naturally result in the payment
            of normal conversion interest, according to the same currency value at the time you created the
            document. <br> <br>
            We charge a single per-document fee. That is, as soon as we have created a document, and it
            is not possible to edit it, and you have already paid for it, then from here on, as much as you
            want additional documents, you will be required to pay for each one of them.
            If you want to produce several different documents, you must go through the document
            production process and payment, for each document separately.<br> <br>
            Once you have paid for a document, there is no technical possibility of going back. That is, if
            you think that the payment you paid is incorrect, or that the service you received is insufficient
            and does not deserve payment, please contact us with the details below. We promise to do as
            much as possible to serve you in the best possible way.<br> <br>
            Once you have paid for a document, it cannot be edited, nor changed, nor replaced, nor
            canceled. Once the document is created and paid for, there is no going back.<br>
            Note that, the last point at which you can regret creating the document, or change it, or edit it, is
            before you have paid. In order to do so, you can simply refresh the page, and start the process
            of defining the search again. You may also need to re-register.<br> <br>
            Please note, we cannot be held responsible for mistakes made on your part. If you create a
            document with incorrect data such as the second email address, or incorrect keywords, or
            incorrect dates, you will not be able to change this data after you have created the document. <br> <br>
            If you think a mistake has been made on our part, please contact us and we will try to help
            correct it as much as possible.<br>
